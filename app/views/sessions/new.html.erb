<h1>Please Log in</h1>

<%= form_with model: @user, url: login_path, method: :post do |f| %>

<h3>A note about logging in</h3>
There is no password field. In fact, there is no indication whatsoever that you are who you say you are. There's nothing special about users - username is just another piece of data that the user entered and we have to keep track of.

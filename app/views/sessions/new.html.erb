  <h2>Log In</h2>

  <p>
    Username must be less than 15 characters and only contain:
    <ul>
      <li>  lowercase letters (a-z)  </li>
      <li>  numbers (0-9)  </li>
      <li>  dashes (-)  </li>
      <li>  underscores (_)  </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <%= form_with method: :post, url: sessions_path do |f| %>
  <div class="form-group">
    <%= f.label :username%>
    <div class="col-md-8" >
      <%= f.text_field :username, class: "form-control"%>
    </div>
  </div>
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">  Log In </button>
  <% end %>

  <h3>A note about logging in</h3>
  <p>
    There is no password field. In fact, there is no indication whatsoever that you are who you say you are. There's nothing special about users - username is just another piece of data that the user entered and we have to keep track of.
  </p>

  <p>
    We'll learn more about security and authentication in the next couple weeks. For now, don't worry about it beyond what you can see here.
